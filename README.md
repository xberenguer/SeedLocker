- 72D TPU: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005006684814458.html

**Printing Instructions**
- The lid is printed using 95A TPU for the first few layers for the best transparency, while the remainder of the container is printed with 72D TPU for its rigidity.
- The container is filled with a ratio of 1 red bead, 2 black beads, and 6 white beads, totaling approximately 12g.
