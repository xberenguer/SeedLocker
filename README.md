**Overview**
- SeedLocker is a reusable tamper-evident solution. It features a mechanism in the lid that keeps beads securely locked in place when the jar is closed, that get easily disrupted when the cap is slightly twisted
- Each time you close this jar you get a unique pattern that is impossible to replicate. You can take a photo of the jar in the current state and compare it next time it is opened to ensure the integrity of the contents

 **Materials used**
- Flat Print Bed: https://store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-smooth-pei-plate
- 2mm no hole beads: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005109249326.html
- 77D TPU from kexcelled: https://www.kexcelled3d.com/filaments/flexible

**Printing Instructions**
- The transparent part of the lid is a single layer, printed in transparent 77D TPU on a flat print plate.
- The middle part and jar is printed in PLA
- The lid is filled with different color beads. In the photos we use a ratio of 1 red bead, 2 black beads, and 6 white beads, totaling approximately 12g



The Blink Comparison App by proninyaroslav can be useful for comparing the patterns

Note: This project is still a work in progress. It is open source and in the public domain, so anyone is welcome to contribute! Huge thanks to Seed for the addition of the V index on the lid
