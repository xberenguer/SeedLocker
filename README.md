**Overview**
- SeedLocker is a reusable tamper-evident solution. It features a mechanism in the lid that keeps beads securely locked in place when the jar is closed, that get easily disrupted when the cap is slightly twisted
- Each time you close this jar you get a unique pattern that is impossible to replicate. You can take a photo of the jar in the current state and compare it next time it is opened to ensure the integrity of the contents

**Printing Instructions**
- The transparent part of the lid is a single layer, printed in transparent 77D TPU on a flat print plate.
